We also assume they have at least a little experience with other technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js, and others. What You Will Learn How to work with the RxPHP library and see what it offers via many examples Use the RxPHP library in combination with Symfony Console The different approaches to using Symfony3's Event Dispatcher component Test your reactive PHP code using PHPUnit Analyze PHP source code and apply a custom set of rules by building a CLI tool In Detail Reactive Programming helps us write code that is concise, clear, and readable. Combining the power of reactive programming and PHP, one of the most widely used languages, will enable you to create web applications more pragmatically. PHP Reactive Programming will teach you the benefits of reactive programming via real-world examples with a hands-on approach. You will create multiple projects showing RxPHP in action alone and in combination with other libraries. The book starts with a brief introduction to reactive programming, clearly explaining the importance of building reactive applications. You will use the RxPHP library, built a reddit CLI using it, and also re-implement the Symfony3 Event Dispatcher with RxPHP. You will learn how to test your RxPHP code by writing unit tests. Moving on to more interesting aspects, you will implement a web socket backend by developing a browser game. You will learn to implement quite complex reactive systems while avoiding pitfalls such as circular dependencies by moving the RxJS logic from the frontend to the backend. The book will then focus on writing extendable RxPHP code by developing a code testing tool and also cover Using RxPHP on both the server and client side of the application. With a concluding chapter on reactive programming practices in other languages, this book will serve as a complete guide for you to start writing reactive applications in PHP. Style and approach This book will teach readers how to build reactive applications in a step-by-step manner. It will also present several examples of reactive applications implemented with different frameworks.",

       "description": "The Perl Journal (TPJ) did something most print journals aspire to, but few succeed. Within a remarkable short time, TPJ acquired a cult-following and became the voice of the Perl community. Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. Back issues were swapped like trading cards. No longer in print format, TPJ remains the quintessential spirit of Perl--a publication for and by Perl programmers who see fun and beauty in an admittedly quirky little language.Games, Diversions, and Perl Culture is the third volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes.The 47 articles included in this volume are simply some of the best Perl articles ever written on the subjects of games, diversions, and the unique culture of this close-knit community, by some of the best Perl authors and coders. Games, Diversions & Perl Culture focuses on entertaining topics that make Perl users such fanatics about the language. You'll find all of the playful features TPJ offered over the years, including the Obfuscated Perl Contests, Perl Quiz Shows, humor articles, and renowned one-line recipes. The book also contains a panoply of quirky applications of Perl, including genetic algorithms, home automation, music programming, and an entire section on natural language processing.This anthology is an unmatched compendium of Perl lore.",

       "description": "Groovy Programming is an introduction to the Java-based scripting language Groovy. Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming. This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL. The first comprehensive book on Groovy programming that shows how writing applications and scripts for the Java platform is fast and easy Written by leading software engineers and acclaimed computing instructors Offers numerous programming examples, code samples, detailed case studies, exercises for self-study, and a companion website with a Windows-based Groovy editor",

One species in the subgenus Zimmermannia and four species in the subgenus Ectoedemia are described as new: Ectoedemia (Zimmermannia) vivesi A. La?t?vka, Z. La?t?vka & Van Nieukerken sp. n. from southern Spain and Cyprus with unknown host plant, Ectoedemia (E.) hendrikseni A. La?t?vka, Z. La?t?vka & Van Nieukerken sp. n. from southern France on Quercus suber, E. (E.) heckfordi Van Nieukerken, A. La?t?vka & Z. La?t?vka sp. n. from southern England on Quercus petraea and Q. robur, E. (E.) phaeolepis Van Nieukerken, A. La?t?vka & Z. La?t?vka sp. n. from Spain and Portugal probably on Quercus ilex and Q. rotundifolia and E. (E.) coscoja Van Nieukerken, A. La?t?vka & Z. La?t?vka sp. n. from Spain on Quercus coccifera. The following species are redescribed: Ectoedemia (Zimmermannia) hispanica Van Nieukerken 1985, Ectoedemia (Zimmermannia) reichli Z. & A. La?t?vka 1998, Ectoedemia (E.) algeriensis van Nieukerken 1985, E. (E.) pseudoilicis Z. & A. La?t?vka 1998 and E. (E.) alnifoliae van Nieukerken 1985. Ectoedemia albiformae Puplesis & Di?kus 2003 is synonymised with E. spinosella (Joannis, 1908). Ectoedemia jacutica Puplesis 1988, previously synonymised with E. agrimoniae (Frey, 1858), is here synonymised with E. spiraeae Gregor & Povoln? 1983.

It encompasses current forensic DNA analysis methods, as well as biology, technology and genetic interpretation. This book reviews the methods of forensic DNA testing used in the first two decades since early 1980’s, and it offers perspectives on future trends in this field, including new genetic markers and new technologies. Furthermore, it explains the process of DNA testing from collection of samples through DNA extraction, DNA quantitation, DNA amplification, and statistical interpretation. The book also discusses DNA databases, which play an important role in law enforcement investigations. In addition, there is a discussion about ethical concerns in retaining DNA profiles and the issues involved when people use a database to search for close relatives. Students of forensic DNA analysis, forensic scientists, and members of the law enforcement and legal professions who want to know more about STR typing will find this book invaluable. Includes a glossary with over 400 terms for quick reference of unfamiliar terms as well as an acronym guide to decipher the DNA dialect Continues in the style of Forensic DNA Typing, 2e, with high-profile cases addressed in D.N.A.Boxes-- \"Data, Notes & Applications\" sections throughout Ancillaries include: instructor manual Web site, with tailored set of 1000+ PowerPoint slides (including figures), links to online training websites and a test bank with key",

In order to avoid the faulta of traditional grammars, this study has been deliberately based on a structural theory, using Halliday's Scale and Category model. Dr Bamgbose's study of Yoruba was the first full-length exemplification of this theory to be published, and will continue to be of interest to general linguists as well as to specialists in West African languages and Yoruba scholars.",

The book covers topics from introductory level right up to cutting edge research. High-profile cases are addressed throughout the text, near the sections dealing with the science or issues behind these cases. Ten new chapters have been added to accommodate the explosion of new information since the turn of the century. These additional chapters cover statistical genetic analysis of DNA data, an emerging field of interest to DNA research. Several chapters on statistical analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) typing data have been contributed by Dr. George Carmody, a well-respected professor in forensic genetics. Specific examples make the concepts of population genetics more understandable. This book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in forensic DNA analysis, forensic scientists, population geneticists, military and private and public forensic laboratories (for identifying individuals through remains), and students of forensic science. *The only book available that specifically covers detailed information on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome *Chapters cover the topic from introductory level right up to \"cutting edge\" research *High-profile cases are addressed throughout the book, near the sections dealing with the science or issues behind these cases *NEW TO THIS EDITION: D.N.A.

Since the appearance of the first edition in 2008, this work has proven critical to successful “pops” concert programming. With changes in publishers and agents, the discontinuation of the publication of certain original material or, worst of all, presses going out of business, music directors, orchestra conductors, and professional instrumentalists face formidable challenges in tracking down accurate information about this vast repertoire. This revised handbook alleviates the time-consuming task of researching these changes by offering a list of works for orchestral “pops” concerts that is comprehensive, informative, and current. Manning’s emphasis on clarity and accuracy gives users an indispensable tool for gathering vital information on the style, instrumentation, and availability of the repertoire listed, as well as notes on its performance. The user-friendly appendices include expanded instrumentation choices, easy-to-find durations, and handy title cross-references. In addition to corrections and updates, this new edition of Orchestral “Pops” Music includes at least 1,000 new title listings. Orchestral “Pops” Music: A Handbook is the ideal tool for working conductors and orchestral librarians, as well as music program directors at colleges, conservatories, and orchestras.",
